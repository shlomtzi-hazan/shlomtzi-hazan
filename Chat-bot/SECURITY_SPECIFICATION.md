# Enhancing Security in FastAPI App

## Objective
To address security issues in the FastAPI application related to file upload and access control.

---

## Identified Issues
1. **Unrestricted File Access**: Any user connected to the app can access uploaded files via the `/upload` endpoint.
2. **Lack of Group-Based Permissions**: The app does not support granting access to files based on specific user groups.

---

## Proposed Solution

### User Authentication and Identification
- Implement a user identification stage requiring a **username** and **password**.
- Only authenticated users can interact with the `/upload` endpoint or access files.

### File Access Control
- Allow file uploaders to specify access permissions:
  - **Private**: Only the uploader can access the file.
  - **Group**: Accessible by users within a specified group.
  - **Public**: Accessible by all users.

### Admin Management
- Introduce an admin profile to manage users and groups:
  - Add new users to groups or remove them as needed.
  - Maintain a secure record of groups and their members.

---

## Data Structure
Maintain a table or dictionary containing user details:
- `username`
- `password`
- `groups` (comma-separated list)
- `is_admin` flag

---

## System Flow

### Authentication and Identification

#### Existing Users:
1. Prompt for a **username**.
2. Check if the username exists:
   - If the username exists, prompt for a **password**.
   - Verify the password against stored credentials.
   - If valid, grant access to the app.

#### New Users:
1. If the username does not exist, offer the option to **register a new account**.
2. Registration process:
   - Prompt the user to create a **username** and **password**.
   - Ask if the user belongs to any group(s).
   - If the user selects a group, send a request to the **Admin** for approval.
   - Inform the user that their request is pending admin approval.
   - Save the user’s details in the system with the `is_admin` flag set to `False`.
3. Allow the new user to log in and upload files, but restrict access to group-related files until admin approval is granted.

### Example Pseudo-Code for New Users

```python
users = {}  # Dictionary to store user data

def register_user(username, password, group=None):
    if username in users:
        return "Username already exists."
    users[username] = {
        "password": password,
        "groups": [group] if group else [],
        "is_admin": False
    }
    if group:
        send_admin_approval_request(username, group)
        return "Account created. Group access request sent to admin."
    return "Account created. No group specified."
```

---

## Admin Approval Workflow
- Admin receives a notification or a request to add the user to a group.
- Admin can approve or reject the request.
- Upon approval, the group is added to the user’s record, granting them access to group-specific files.

---

## File Upload Workflow

### Authenticated Upload:
1. Prompt the uploader to select file access permissions:
   - **Private**
   - **Group-based** (specify group name)
   - **Public**
2. Store metadata about file ownership and permissions.

### File Access:
1. Verify user permissions before granting access.

#### Example Pseudo-Code:
```python
def can_access_file(user, file_metadata):
    if file_metadata['access'] == 'public':
        return True
    if file_metadata['access'] == 'private' and file_metadata['owner'] == user:
        return True
    if file_metadata['access'] == 'group' and user in file_metadata['groups']:
        return True
    return False
```

---

## Admin Role
Admin users can:
1. Create, update, or delete groups.
2. Approve user requests to join groups.
3. Access all data files and share files or restrict file sharing.

---

## System Workflow

### When a User Logs In:
1. Prompt for a **username**:
   - If the user exists:
     - Ask for a password.
     - Grant access to their files or relevant functionalities.
   - If the user doesn’t exist:
     - Prompt to create a new user.
     - Request admin approval for group assignment.

### When Uploading a File:
- Prompt the user to define access permissions: **Private**, **Group**, or **Public**.

### When Accessing Files:
- Check user permissions against file metadata.
- Deny access with a clear message if permissions are insufficient.

---

## Next Steps
1. Define API endpoints for user authentication, file upload, and file access.
2. Implement the admin interface for group and user management.
3. Integrate the new identification stage and ensure smooth workflow transitions.
4. Test the application to ensure all security measures are working as expected.
