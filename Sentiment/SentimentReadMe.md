## üß± **App Architecture**

Use a modular approach:

### 1. **Data Pipeline**
| Source       | Data Type     | Tool to Use               |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Reddit       | Public posts  | Reddit API (via PRAW)     |
| Google News  | Headlines     | Google News API / SERP API or BeautifulSoup |

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- Use **VADER** (for simplicity) or **transformer-based models** (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) for Reddit posts.
- Assign sentiment score (e.g., -1 to 1) per post, aggregated per hour/day.
- Consider calculating:
  - Rolling sentiment average
  - Volume of posts per company

### 3. **Event Detection from News**
- Extract keywords and named entities using **spaCy** or `keyBERT`.
- Match company mentions (Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Olipop).
- Score ‚Äúevent impact‚Äù using frequency + sentiment + post spike after news.

### 4. **Storage**
- Store all data in **SQLite**, **Pandas DataFrames**, or a lightweight **JSON** file depending on simplicity.
